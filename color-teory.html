              <h2>Image contrast</h2>
              <p>Contrast is the scale of difference between black and white in your images. Without contrast you wouldn't have an image because there wouldn't be any differentiation between light and dark; everything would be black, white, or a single shade of grey somewhere in between.</p>
              <p>Contrast is the difference in brightness between objects or regions. A white rabbit running across a snowy field has poor contrast, while a black dog against the same white background has good contrast.</p>

              <h2>Image brightness</h2>
              <p>Brightness refers to the overall lightness or darkness of the image.</p>
              <p>Four possible ways that brightness and contrast can be misadjusted. When the brightness is too high, the whitest pixels are saturated, destroying the detail in these areas. The reverse is where the brightness is set too low, saturating the blackest pixels. When the contrast is set to high, resulting in the blacks being too black, and the whites being too white. Lastly, the contrast set too low; all of the pixels are a mid-shade of gray making the objects fade into each other.</p>

              HSLA makes more intuitive what changing the values will do to the
              color. Increasing the second value will increase the saturation of

              of that color.

              Saturation is the intensity of a hue from gray tone (no

            <p>Without saturation, hye is irrelevant -- rotating the hue when saturation is 0% doesn't actually change the color at all</p>

              Brightness is the relative lightness or darkness of a particular

              <h2>Saturation vs brightness</h2>
              <p>
                The illustration above shows the difference between saturation
                and brightness. We first pick a blue hue from the color wheel
                (stretched out into a line to make a prettier illustration). We
                can then reduce the saturation so that the blue hue becomes more
                and more blue gray. With zero saturation it is gray. We pick a
                less saturated blue tone and then turn the brightness up and
                down on that tone. Note that increasing the brightness is not
                the same as decreasing saturation. Decreasing saturation turns
                the colors into gray shades.
              </p>
              <p>
                Increasing brightness turns a blue into a lighter sky blue but
                without making it gray.
              </p>
              <p>
                Taking an almost totally desaturated blue, so desaturated it is
                almost perfectly gray, and increasing the brightness will result
                in what appear to be lighter shades of gray. However, if there
                is any "blue" at all in the gray by increasing saturation we can
                achieve a bright blue again.
